# Web_Scraping1
## This project automates hotel data collection from one Hotel Booking sites, saving time and providing clean, structured data ready for analysis.
## What it does:
### Scrapes hotel details including names, prices, ratings, location, reviews, and links.
### Allows users to input their own URL and filename, specifying where the CSV file will be saved.
### Handles missing values gracefully, ensuring the dataset remains clean even if some hotels have incomplete information.
## How it works:
### Uses requests & BeautifulSoup libraries to extract data from the website.
### Processes multiple hotels, pages, and locations automatically.
### Converts messy HTML into organized, ready-to-use CSV files for analysis.
